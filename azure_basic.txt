=========================================================================================================================================
DEVOPS:


DevOps brings together people, processes, and technology by automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. With Azure DevOps, you can create build and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment, and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

Service name

Description

Azure DevOps

Use development collaboration tools such as high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing. Formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services.

Azure DevTest Labs

Quickly create on-demand Windows and Linux environments to test or demo applications directly from deployment pipelines.

====================================================================================

Azure  Account :
To create a azure account we need to have azure subscriptions 
We may have the sandbox Environment  for Our Learning Purpose  Learn Sandbox 
Once the Subscription is created you can start  creating Azure resorurce  for each subscription

A  Corporate/Business Account may have one account and  Many  Subscriptions in the account. which is used for maintaing the all the Necessary 
Services like Infra/Data/DevOps/IAM 


==================================================================================================================================

					AZURE  ARCHITECTURAL  COMPONENTS

==================================================================================================================================

First  we need to create a Resource Group in Azure:

We can have the Subnet Virtual Machines  and Storage Account Created in RG 

=================================================================================================================================
VMs are an ideal choice when you need:

Total control over the operating system (OS).
The ability to run custom software.
To use custom hosting configurations.


You can get a VM but  you still  need to get configured   that runs  and maintains the software

When can we  use the VM's
During the test and development 
When running the applications in cloud
When extending the DataCenter in Cloud 
During Disaster Recovery 



VM's are the best  options  when moving from on premisis  to Cloud  (lift and shift)


Scale  VM's in Azure 

Azure VM Scale Sets and Azure Batch


Scale Sets  are something  which create  Identical VM's    using scale up  you can increases the VM's  and scale down you can decrease the VM's \



Azure Batch:
Creates  VM's  as per the requirement an 
Starts a pool of compute VMs for you.
Installs applications and staging data.
Runs jobs with as many tasks as you have.
Identifies failures.
Requeues work.
Scales down the pool as work completes.




When To use  AppService:
App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, 
mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
 It offers automatic scaling and high availability.
 App Service supports Windows and Linux and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps,
  or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.
  
  
  Azure App Service is  a Paas   which enables you to focus on the Website and the APi Logic
  
  
  Types:
  Web Apps
  API Apps
  Mobile Apps
  
  WebJobs
 
 ==========================================================================================================
 
 Decide when the  Containers and Kubernetes  are used :
 if we want to run multiple instances of  an application in a single host Machine.  then Containerization is good choice
 
 
 
 Virtual  Machines Virtualize the Hardware  . Containers  virtualize the Operating  System
 
 
 Containers are managed through Container Orchestrator 
 
 
 There are two ways to  manage  both Docker and   Microsoft based containers.  
 Azure Container Instances 
 s. It's a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it runs for you.
 Azure Kubernetes  Service:
 The task of automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers is known as orchestration. 
 
 Container are managed through Container Orchestrator which can start /stop/scale up  the application instances  as needed
 



Containers are oftenly used to create solutions by using  Microservices architecture  




=========================
Azure Functions:
 we have a work to do  that  is  dependent on some other work  
 Azure Functions are used and called as serverless  computing 
 it is abstraction of servers infrastructure  and systems
 
 
 Serverless  computing includes 
 Abstraction of servers
 Event Driven Scale 
 Micro Billing 
 
 
 ====================================
 Azure has  two implementations  of Serverless Compute 
 Azure Functions:Functions can execute code in almost any modern language.
 Azure Logic Apps: Logic apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.




When you're concerned only about the code running your service, and not the underlying platform or infrastructure,
 using Azure Functions is ideal. 
 
 Functions  scale  automatically based on demand
 
 Functiions  can be either stateless or stateful 
 hen they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event. 
 When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Logic Apps 

these are similar to functions both enables  us to execute logic  based  on event.. the diff is  functions  execute  code/script Logic Apps  execute
WorkFlows

both are formed from predifined   logic blocks
 Each time the trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs the actions in the workflow
 
 These actions can also include data conversions and flow controls, such as conditional statements, switch statements, loops, and branching.
 
 the work flows  are persisted in JSON
