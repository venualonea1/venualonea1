=========================================================================================================================================
DEVOPS:


DevOps brings together people, processes, and technology by automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. With Azure DevOps, you can create build and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment, and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

Service name

Description

Azure DevOps

Use development collaboration tools such as high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing. Formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services.

Azure DevTest Labs

Quickly create on-demand Windows and Linux environments to test or demo applications directly from deployment pipelines.

====================================================================================

Azure  Account :
To create a azure account we need to have azure subscriptions 
We may have the sandbox Environment  for Our Learning Purpose  Learn Sandbox 
Once the Subscription is created you can start  creating Azure resorurce  for each subscription

A  Corporate/Business Account may have one account and  Many  Subscriptions in the account. which is used for maintaing the all the Necessary 
Services like Infra/Data/DevOps/IAM 


==================================================================================================================================

					AZURE  ARCHITECTURAL  COMPONENTS

==================================================================================================================================

First  we need to create a Resource Group in Azure:

We can have the Subnet Virtual Machines  and Storage Account Created in RG 

=================================================================================================================================
VMs are an ideal choice when you need:

Total control over the operating system (OS).
The ability to run custom software.
To use custom hosting configurations.


You can get a VM but  you still  need to get configured   that runs  and maintains the software

When can we  use the VM's
During the test and development 
When running the applications in cloud
When extending the DataCenter in Cloud 
During Disaster Recovery 



VM's are the best  options  when moving from on premisis  to Cloud  (lift and shift)


Scale  VM's in Azure 

Azure VM Scale Sets and Azure Batch


Scale Sets  are something  which create  Identical VM's    using scale up  you can increases the VM's  and scale down you can decrease the VM's \



Azure Batch:
