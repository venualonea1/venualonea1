Azure Virtual networks allows us to communcate the azure  resources such as web apps  databases  VM's  with each other and with users  in internet
Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:

Isolation and segmentation
Internet communications
Communicate between Azure resources
Communicate with on-premises resources
Route network traffic
Filter network traffic
Connect virtual networks



Isolation :
VNet allows  you to create  multiple isolated virtual networks   when you setup a virtual network  we define private address space  either by private  or 
public ip address ranges 

YOu can divide that Private Ip into Subnets and allocate  part of the defined space 
for Name resolution we can use the name resolutions service 


we can configure the Virtual network to use  either internal or external DNS Server

===========================================================================
A VM in Azure can connect to the internet by default. 
You can enable incoming connections from the internet by defining a public IP address or a public load balancer.

Communication between azure resources:
Azure resources are resources  created in Azure Cloud can communicate using two ways  securely


Virtual  networks  : A Vnet not only connects  VM but also  Azure resources like webapps  Power Apps  AKS  ACS and VMScale Sets


Service  End Points:
which allows  us to link multiple  Azure Resources  to Virtual Networks 




Communication to Onprem resources:
Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription

ou can create a network that spans both your local and cloud environments. There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:


point to site  Vprivate networks
 In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect that computer to the Azure virtual network.
Site -to site  V private Networks

Azure Express Route:

DIrect  Physical connection



ROUTE NETWORK TRAFFIC:
By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet.
we can control  the traffic  below 

Route Table: Defines how the traffic should be re-directed 
ou can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.

BGP:  Border  Gateway Protocol works with Azure virtual gateways  or Express Route  to propogate on premisis BGP to Virtual network gateways





Filter  Network Traffic:
Azure  Virtual networks  fiters  network traffic between subnets by following approaches


1: network security Groups
 A network security group is an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules.
 ou can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
 
2:  Virtual network Appliances:
s A network virtual appliance is a specialized VM that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. 
it carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.







======================================================================================

Connecting to VIrtual networks :
 You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering
 Peering enables  resources  in each network   to communicate  with each other 
 These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.
 
 
 
 UDR:UDR is user-defined Routing
 his allows network admins to control the routing tables between subnets within a VNet, as well as between VNets, 
thereby allowing for greater control over network traffic flow.



Subnet names must begin with a letter or number and end with a letter, number, or underscore.
 They may contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, or hyphens.
