AZURE  VPN Gateway:
VPNs use an encrypted tunnel within another network.
They're typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network


A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. 
Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in Azure Virtual Network instances and enable the following connectivity:


Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.


You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network,
 but you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, 
which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.\


When you deploy a VPN Gateway we specify the VPN type:  
either  policy based or   route based
diff. between two iis  how  traffic is encrypted. In Azure  bboth type  of  gateway's are used  preshared Keys as only  authentication
and also rely on  IKE  internet Key Exchangee  and  IPSec


POLICY BASED VPN's:
Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel. 

Key features of policy-based VPN gateways in Azure include:


Support for IKEv1 only.


Use of static routing, where combinations of address prefixes from both networks control how traffic is encrypted and decrypted through the VPN tunnel. The source and destination of the tunneled networks are declared in the policy and don't need to be declared in routing tables.

Policy-based VPNs must be used in specific scenarios that require them, such as for compatibility with legacy on-premises VPN devices.


=====================================================================================================================
Route Based VPN's
If defining which IP addresses are behind each tunnel is too cumbersome, route-based gateways can be used.


with Route based IPSec  are modulated as  Network interfaces  or virtual tunnel interface

IP Routing decides which one of the tunnel interfaces  can be used to  send the each packet 



Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:

Connections between virtual networks
Point-to-site connections
Multisite connections
Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway



Key features of route-based VPN gateways in Azure include:

Supports IKEv2
Uses any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors
Can use dynamic routing protocols, where routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPSec tunnels 





A Basic VPN gateway should only be used for Dev/Test workloads. In addition,
 it's unsupported to migrate from Basic to the VpnGW1/2/3/Az SKUs at a later time without having to remove the gateway and redeploy.
 
 
 
 
 Before  u  deploy  We need some of the resources  created  with azure

 VIRTUAL NETWORK:
 
 
 
  we need to have VNET  with enouth space , for additional subnet created that is needed for VPN Gateway, Address Space for the VNET must  not
  overlap with the on-premisis network
  
  
  
  
  GATEWAY SUBNET:
  Deploy  a  subnet called  Gateway Subnet for  VPN Gateway  this canot be used  for the any other services
  
  PUBLIC IP  ADDRESS:
  create  a basic  sku  dynamc public  ip adddress 
 wich  is used to connect the  to connect  from Datacenter to On Premise  
 
 
 LOCAN  NETWORK GATEWAY
 
 VIRTAUL NETWORK  GATEWAY
 Connection. Create a connection resource to create a logical connection between the VPN gateway and the local network gateway
 
 
 
 
The connection is made to the on-premises VPN device's IPv4 address as defined by the local network gateway.
The connection is made from the virtual network gateway and its associated public IP address.






HIGH AVAIILABLITY SCENARIO's:



ACTIVE/PASSIVE:
By default, VPN gateways are deployed as two instances in an active/standby configuration
