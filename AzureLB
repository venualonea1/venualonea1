->Azure LB is Layer 4 Architecture (OSI) Open System Interconnection, it is a single point to the clients
->Load balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances
->A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network,
translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses
-> Can be used for  load balancing the VM's


Internal or Private Load Balancers:
Internal Load Balancers  are used where the private IP's  are needed  at the front end Only, these are used to  loadbalance the traffic  inside 
Virtual Network
->  LB Support  both inbound and outbound services, it provides  low latency and high throughput 
Configure outbound connectivity for the azure virtual machines 

Employ port forwarding to access virtual machines
also support  load balancing for IPV6

move  internal to external loadbalancers across the Azure regions
